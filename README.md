# README

This is the result of a Rails bootcamp I did. 

The site is basically a forum for developers. If you sign up for a fee, you get contact info of the developers revealed. 

The site is pretty outdated and with security vulnerabilities, as warned by github.

It looks basically like this: http://dev-match.herokuapp.com/
